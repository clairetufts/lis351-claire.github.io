				<p> Going to concerts is one of my favorite things to do in the summer. I have seen a handful of different artists with different genres of music. I've seen rock artists, rap artists, pop artists, and country artists. I think my favorite is country concerts because the vibes and the ambiance is really cool. My top 3 favorite concerts I've been to are: </p>
				<ul>
					<li>Motley Crue and Def Leopard</li>
					<li>Zach Bryan</li>
					<li>Metallica</li>
				</ul>
