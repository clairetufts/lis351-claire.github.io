				<p> My cabin is my favorit place on Earth. It is located in Turtle Lake Wisconsin, and is about a 2 hour drive from my house. The cabin is on small lake called Pipe Lake and my favorite thing to do there are going on boat rides, jetskiing, and tanning with my sister. We also do a lot of fishing and make campfires every night. </p>
